# Demo! Spring Boot Kotlin -- gRPC!

This service provides both API Http and gRPC (without duplicate code ðŸ”¥). So, Client can choose their communication method by gRPC or simple way Http.

## Dependencies

- [Spring](https://spring.io/) spring framework
- [gRPC-Spring-Boot-Starter](https://yidongnan.github.io/grpc-spring-boot-starter/en/) gRPC Spring Boot Starter
- [ktlint-maven-plugin](https://github.com/gantsign/ktlint-maven-plugin) ktlint Maven Plugin
- [Flywaydb](https://flywaydb.org/) for database migrations

And I use these tools to test gRPC server (There are a lot of awesome tools actually)

- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) command-line tool to interact with gRPC servers
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) API testing tool (v10.8.7 [now support gRPC](https://blog.postman.com/postman-now-supports-grpc/)) 

## System Requirements
- Java 11
- Kotlin 1.6.21
- Postgresql

```bash
# Install homebrew first
# For Non-Mac user, I'm sure you can find your own way!
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew services start postgresql

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:kw-bucket/spring-boot-kotlin--grpc.git

# Migrate schema to latest version
$ mvn -Dflyway.configFiles=flyway.local.conf flyway:migrate
```

## Run Locally
```bash
# Run unit tests
# Code style will be checked after test using ktlint ;-)

```

I'm sure and believe that anyone present here will find your way to make better understanding on your own. <br/>
